This file is what I use for my 3rd person character controllers. It is a take on the controller you can find in the Start Assets for 3rd Person Movement found here:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526
the main change is that mine uses delegates to be more flexible with the new Input System being input device agnostic.
