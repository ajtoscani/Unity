# 3rdPersonController

This file is what I use for my 3rd person character controllers. 

It is a take on the controller you can find in the Starter Assets for 3rd Person Movement found here:

The main change is that mine uses delegates to be more flexible with the new Input System being input device agnostic.

If unfamiliar with delegates my suggestion for material is One Wheel Studio's video here:
