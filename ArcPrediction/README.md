# ArcPrediction

The goal of this script is to take a start and end point and calculate a parabola/arc between them with a custom arc height available.

The idea was to not use ballistic calculations to provide a more stylized approach to projectile shooting or lobbing.

My main source of reference that was invaluable when trying to figure this out can be found here:
